# 🧩 Pi Extensions for the Pi Coding Agent

[![npm scope](https://img.shields.io/badge/npm-@narumitw-blue)](https://www.npmjs.com/org/narumitw) [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)](./LICENSE)

Independently installable [Pi Coding Agent](https://pi.dev) extensions and reusable extension
libraries for coding, research, browser automation, workflow management, observability, and terminal
ergonomics.

Install only what you need. Every package is published separately under the `@narumitw` npm scope.

## 🚀 Quick start

Install an extension permanently:

```bash
pi install npm:@narumitw/pi-goal
```

Try one without adding it permanently:

```bash
pi -e npm:@narumitw/pi-statusline
```

Combine multiple extensions:

```bash
pi -e npm:@narumitw/pi-goal \
  -e npm:@narumitw/pi-statusline \
  -e npm:@narumitw/pi-lsp
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Pi extensions run with your full user permissions. Review an extension before installing it from any third party.

## 🔧 Advanced installation

<details>
<summary>Install this repository directly from GitHub</summary>

Install the repository as one Pi package:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/narumiruna/pi-extensions
```

The repository root Pi manifest explicitly lists every stable extension under `packages/`, so this enables all of them. Packages marked with the experimental lifecycle are intentionally excluded from the root Git package.

To load only selected extensions, replace the installed package entry in `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` with a resource filter:

```json
{
  "packages": [
    {
      "source": "git:github.com/narumiruna/pi-extensions",
      "extensions": [
        "packages/pi-accounts/src/index.ts",
        "packages/pi-usage/src/index.ts"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Filters use resource paths relative to the repository root. A package directory such as `packages/pi-accounts` is not enough; select its `src/index.ts` entrypoint.

Restart Pi or run `/reload` after changing the filter. Update the checkout later with:

```bash
pi update --extensions
```

</details>

## 🧑‍💻 Local development

From the repository root:

```bash
npm install
npm test
npm run check
```

`npm test` typechecks the test sources and runs the root and workspace suites with Vitest.

Use the generic Just recipes with an unscoped extension name:

```bash
just try goal
just pack goal

# Experimental packages use the same recipes
just try file-context
just pack file-context

# Libraries use the same generic pack recipe
just pack tui-kit
```

Run `just --list` to see all development, install, pack, and release recipes. Pull requests that
change published package behavior should add release intent with `npm run changeset`; packages version
independently.

<details>
<summary>Publishing a new scoped package</summary>

`just npm-public @narumitw/pi-new-extension` only changes visibility for an existing npm package. If npm returns 404 for a brand-new package, publish it once with public access:

```bash
npm publish --workspace @narumitw/pi-new-extension --access public
```

After the initial publication, Changesets handles stable extensions, experimental extensions, and
libraries through independent package versions.

</details>

## 🦋 Releases

A behavior-changing package pull request records its affected packages and SemVer bumps with:

```bash
npm run changeset
```

After changesets reach `main`, the release workflow creates or updates one version pull request. That
pull request changes only selected package versions, dependency ranges where configured, changelogs,
and the lockfile. Merging it publishes the new versions with npm provenance and creates
package-specific tags and GitHub releases such as `@narumitw/pi-goal@0.50.0`.

Repository-only documentation, tests, tooling, and path migrations may omit a changeset. Use
`npm run changeset:status` to inspect pending releases. Versioning and publication run through the
release workflow; initial publication remains the manually approved exception described above.

`@narumitw/pi-tui-kit` remains independently versioned. Publish a new Kit API before raising an
extension's compatibility floor to consume it; do not release an unpublished Kit API and its first
consumer together.

## 🗂️ Repository structure

```text
packages/                Stable extensions, experimental extensions, and reusable libraries
deprecated/              Reference packages excluded from active workspace scripts
docs/                    Repository conventions and plans
scripts/                 Shared checks, tests, versioning, and release helpers
test/                    Root integration and repository tests
```

Each active package contains its own `package.json`, `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `tsconfig.json`, and
TypeScript source under `src/`. Extension `src/index.ts` files are thin Pi entrypoints and declare a
stable or experimental lifecycle; reusable libraries publish built ESM and declarations from `dist/`.

<details>
<summary>Deprecated packages</summary>

The following packages remain available as source references but are excluded from active workspace scripts:

- `pi-biome-lsp` and `pi-python-lsp` — replaced by [`pi-lsp`](./packages/pi-lsp)
- `pi-codex-accounts` — replaced by [`pi-accounts`](./packages/pi-accounts)
- `pi-codex-usage` — replaced by [`pi-usage`](./packages/pi-usage)
